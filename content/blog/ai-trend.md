## Get on the train...

I feel like I need to metaphorically shout from the rooftop about AI progress. If you have not been getting deep into the news, and watching the space, you may not know how much speed the train is gaining. Every single day the progress is beyond the capacity of any one person to understand. You do not want to ignore it anymore. The capacity of machines and Al is going to hit like a meteor in the next year. Even if all foundation model progress were to stop today, the technology is already capable of utterly reforming the entirety of human industry. The foundation model progress is not stopping. The [intelligence explosion][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion] is **RIGHT NOW**. We are in the early stages of recursive improvement. 

If you are not familiar with [AI 2027][https://ai-2027.com/] then take some time to read it. It is the prediction of experts told through a work of fiction.  It remains to be seen how much of their prediction comes true. The 6 months following its publication have so far been decently accurate, in their description of what agentic capabilities would exist as of August 2025. If you're not familiar with the term "agent" or don't know what that means in practical terms: agents are applications which take the generative abilities of LLMs to achieve a complex task. Where GPT 5 can generate text for you via ChatGPT, an agentic application would aim to use GPT 5 to achieve some goal by utilizing the text it generates.

This agentic application layer is what has me thinking about the future. I don't know the answer of what people should do, but I do know that everyone needs to start paying attention and planning for this. This can look multiple ways. Investing financially, or developing new skills. 

For me, its been learning the software tools that are available now. These software tools are like having a software engineering at your disposal (albeit one that needs some really good directions).

I used Figma Make and Claude Code to make this website. I know nearly nothing of web development, and my software skills stop at that of a high school student. Is it as well written as it could be? Nope. That's not the point. The point is that it used to require an entire skillset that I do not have. Now, I can make a project like this in a day.

This example serves another purpose. It shows that the raw capabilities of the foundation models is not the full story. Each of those tools uses a foundation model as its "core intelligence" but that is only half of it. The real power comes from the *application layer*. The foundation models are able to generate text, but if you're able to build an application that utilizes the generated text to achieve a goal, then you have a step change in power. Only recently have we been able to turn this application layer back in on itself with quality coding agents. Now, the development of coding agents can be assisted by coding agents. You'll see this everywhere once you start looking. For example: [FastMCP][https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome] is a python library for setting up a "remote toolbox" for AI agents. You tell the AI agent about these tools, and how to use them in order to achieve some goal. The documentation of FastMCP is purposefully available in a format so that an AI coding agent can read it quickly. That is worth repeating: **The documentation for building AI tools is meant to be read by AI.** 

What's more, the domain of agents is very young. The ideas and frameworks that exist today are not the final form of the field. The techniques we have are very straight forward and not particularly complicated. As the field grows, new techniques will appear that prove faster, more effective, and more efficient.

## Before it leaves the station

I think the near term result will be an explosion of technological innovation performed by small groups. This means that there will be significantly more opportunity for people to develop and scale their own ventures, and that people will be astonishingly productive. You or someone you know will build something great. This will seem commonplace. There will be a societal sense that progress is accelerating, and there will be an abundance of highly accessible technology. 

I am particularly worried about how the balance of this turns out. As our tools improve, which domains will become saturated by cheap automation? These are the domains where we reach the ceiling of productive demand. For instance, mechanical drafting in the United States fell precipitously with the advent of CAD. Sure, hand drafters could go get the new skill set, or change occupation. CAD provided individuals with significantly greater productive capacity. So much so that companies simply needed fewer drafters to meet their goals. There is a ceiling to the demand for production.

This is different than domains where an increase in automation/productivity has not hit a ceiling. In this case, productivity increases are good for employment. In these domains, we always want more. Increases in productivity can change the balance of how much a company is willing to spend on labor of a particular category. If spending "a little more" can bring about a step change in a company's service or product, then they want to do that.

The question for the latter category is, how high is the ceiling? Will we hit this ceiling for some domains in the near future? My personal view is that several, once stable career choices, will fall into this category. Software engineering might fall into the same pool as mechanical drafting. As people gain access and utilize ever more advanced software engineering AI tools, more software engineering will occur. There will come a point though, where software engineering as a dedicated "position" does not make sense for some applications. Why hire a person who is trained to do just that kind of task, when a person who is not trained can do it just as well with the help of an AI tool? As is the case today with drafters, only a small select group of exceptionally talented software engineers may be needed to meet a companies productive needs. Even then, they will be fully immersed in and utilize the state of the art AI tools available to them.

How will this play out when it happens simultaneously across multiple occupations? It depends on how much better these foundational AI models get. Assuming no progress, I think we are in store for a notable, but manageable shift. That is not a safe assumption in my opinion. All evidence has shown thus far that the model's progress is not slowing down. In that case, there is a real risk of significant economic disparity. What happens if a significant portion of the population finds that their skillset is no longer valuable? People who are considered perfectly competent, dependable workers today may find themselves as unemployable in many industries. Information heavy industries such as engineering, finance, marketing, would be the first and most impacted. They would be followed shortly by services, manufacturing, transportation, and construction. It is not that people cannot make money in these industries, but that to do so requires leveraging Al better or in a novel way.

If we are on that path, my view is that "if you can't beat them, join them." I think the best thing any individual can do today is to stay informed about developments in AI, and to start thinking about what they might want to do with the technology. Think about the problems you face in your life or at your work. Can those problems be fixed somehow? Maybe you don't know what that would look like. Now is the time to think about it, and start building.
