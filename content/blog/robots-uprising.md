## The Robots Are Here

Are you ready for the robot uprising? Maybe not the Terminator style hostile takeover of popular fiction, but one of robot population explosion. Impressive demonstrations of robotics have gone viral on the internet several times over the last 10 years. Most notably, Boston Dynamics with their Atlas and Spot robots. These robots are impressive with their agility and super-human mobility. You may notice though, that despite their polished demonstrations, you aren't running into robots in your everyday life. What gives? If these robots are able to navigate environments as well as people, why aren't they already serving you coffee at your local Starbucks?

Robots a combination of hardware and software. Innovation on both sides has accelerated in recent years, but especially on the software side. Even if you can build an assembly capable of performing a backflip or jumping between platforms, how do you actually enable a computer to understand and adapt as it executes that task?

Companies generally fall into one of three categories:

1) They produce the robot hardware
2) They produce software for controlling a robot
3) They do both

Boston Dynamics, the company to capture the popular imagination with their dancing robot dog falls in the last category. Atlas, their humanoid robot is not for sale. As of writing this, Spot costs somewhere around 75K USD to 100k USD.  The controls of Spot are a mixture of direct human input and software. Out of the box, Spot comes with an android tablet with integrated joystick controls. This means a human operator literally drives Spot, actively commanding it to move forward, backward etc. Spot however is not a fancy RC car, it has onboard intelligence. It actively avoids colliding with obstacles. That said, it is by no means a fully autonomous intelligent machine.

It may be tempting to think that these machines have intelligence like that behind large language models, GPT, Gemini, Claude etc. But bridging the gap between the conceptual world of words and physical reality is a novel problem. This gap has been bridged very recently, in a basic way, and companies are actively working to shore up the techniques.

## Why Build Robots at All?

Why build robots at all? We are social creatures, and interacting with robots is not something most people imagine as an emotionally fulfilling experience. Setting the socio-economic question to the side for the moment, do we lose something by swapping the local barista out for a robot? What about the unique human-human connection?

The degree to which we accept this likely depends on both the form and context, however, there is an interesting trend that OpenAI recently [published](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34255/w34255.pdf). Between 2024 and 2025, the share of users conducting chats of "expression" (as opposed to question or task oriented chats) grew from 8% to 13.8%.

Millions of people are using GPT5 to talk about how they are feeling, just have a chat, and discuss their personal development. With the odd exception, I suspect that most people do not consider GPT5 to be a conscious being, and that does not prevent them from finding the interaction worthwhile. This is not to say that it is a replacement for human interaction, or that it is the cure to the loneliness epidemic. What it does suggest is that it is possible to employ AI to engage with people in a way they find emotionally acceptable. Perhaps, you do not need to believe that your local barista is conscious in order to laugh at their joke or appreciate their treatment of you. 

This service application is one that has economic forces behind it. In general, I'll assume most people today don't have a strong preference one way or the other about whether their coffee is made by a person or a machine (or at the very least that they don't prefer machines to people). The real motivation for this kind of transition would be driven by companies trying to reduce cost in response to competition. If your competitor employs 90% fewer people per customer served, then you will not be able to beat their prices. If you lose your customers, you cannot pay your employees and you cannot continue to operate. This is the driver of the contention around the employment of robots. Denial of this motivation is counterproductive in my view, but before diving into that, I want to talk about a real problem we have now and how robotics could make our lives better.

### We Are Getting Older

As higher percentages of a population become educated, the fertility rate decreases. This is true across all countries and cultures. To have a stable population you need about 2.1 children per woman. This means that the average age of countries with fertility rates consistently below this are getting older. As the existing population ages, and elderly people leave the workforce, younger people are not able to replace them. This is a huge issue in South Korea where the fertility rate is around 0.72 and continuing to fall. This means that in under 35 years, there will be not enough people of working age to support the non-working people. The workforce will go from 35 million to only 17 million. That is 18 million workers lost. 

Regardless of the driving forces for the low fertility, the problem is pure mathematics and there is no real solution that is on the table right now. South Korea is a stark warning, and not the exception. The United States actually has a relatively high fertility rate for a developed country at 1.6 children per woman, but that is still below the required 2.1 for a stable population. So the South Korean problem truly is a global one.

The United States has notoriously expensive healthcare of modest quality. Worse yet is the situation for the elderly. If you have ever been in a nursing home, you've probably seen how utterly horrible they are. The people there are often neglected if not abused. Nursing homes are typically very understaffed and the staff that do work there are so burnt out they can hardly care anymore. This has real impacts on resident health, beyond the social isolation. Pressure wounds caused by laying in bed for too long without nurses help moving can and do cause people to lose limbs. It isn't pretty.

Perhaps though, you are fortunate enough to have a family that cares for and lives with you when you are old. This is still no walk in the park. Do you want your son or daughter to wipe your ass for you every day if you cannot do it yourself? You will likely have to confront things like this.

This is one area in which we would actually prefer robots to people. Robots can preserve our dignity when our bodies fail us. They do not stop taking care of you because they are burnt out. They can care for you and your home so that you and your family can do what matters most in your final years. Or at least, that is the vision of several companies.

Startups at the forefront of robotics are aiming to improve the quality of life in the home. They envision robots as in-home assistants and expressly acknowledge their potential in healthcare. In [this video](https://youtu.be/uVcBa6NXAbk) by 1X, they show their NEO Gamma humanoid robot performing menial tasks, cleaning, carrying groceries etc. Their express goal is to build a machine that can perform chores in an effort to lift the burden of homecare. People today work more than ever, and anyone who has come home late to a messy home has experience that defeated feeling like no matter how hard they work, they cannot maintain the order they desire. It is increasingly common for both parents to work to support their children. Despite that, the burden of taking care of the home has not gone away. This is one factor attributed to decreased fertility. It is tough decision to raise children and maintain a career, and often people decide not to because of this. Perhaps with some degree of irony, the adoption of robots is pro-human in this way. 

### The Economic Pressure

I think there is a societal sense that the application of robots in place of traditional human labor is an actively misanthropic force. I don't want to argue for or against that in this piece because in part, I think it is a moot point. Historically, where technology has replaced human labor, protests against it have lost. As an American, I think it is easy to look at this through the window of the labor movement. Our desire to protect the worker's safety and prosperity is good. However, it is counterproductive to argue against development of technology. Instead, we should acknowledge the challenges we will confront and try to bring about a future more desirable than one we blindly stumble into. The car is already barreling forward, better grab the wheel and steer, lest you crash. By refusing to acknowledge a future where a larger and larger fraction of todays human labor is performed by a machine, you are denying yourself and others the ability to prepare for that future. I cannot help but think that that will not be good for anyone.

To that end, I want to highlight facets of the economic pressure to adopt robotics. We can get a few obvious things out of the way: Robots run on electricity and that electricity is cheap, they don't need to sleep, they are diligent and reliable. They can run 24/7, and don't cost more at night (in fact electricity is cheaper at night, where their human counterparts are entitled to increased pay). Where robots are employed today, they carry an enormous cost advantage.

Human labor accounts for 50% of global GDP, 42 trillion USD. In their [Master Plan](https://www.figure.ai/master-plan), Figure AI views this as the size of their potential market. In a 1-1 replacement, human to robot, this makes robotics the single largest industry ever by a longshot. Figure claims that this replacement will be gradual as the technology improves (more on this later), but I think that they are underestimating the demand by a very large degree. As inconceivable as that may seem, let me provide my reasoning.

Consider a hypothetical construction firm "Tom's Robot Company" which employs 30 human-level robot laborers. They are one of several firms which are requested to bid on a new apartment development. Every day that goes by, prior to the apartments being filled, the property management is losing money on overhead and opportunity cost on unfilled apartments. There is a real pressure to go as fast as possible and get tenants.

When all the bids are finalized, Tom's company loses because while they were the cheapest, the other companies were able to guarantee the project completed sooner, offsetting the losses the property manager would have had for the longer lead time. In cases where more labor capacity (more robots) means faster completion, faster will win.

In my experience as an engineer, I have made this tradeoff many times. The overhead of the company I work for usually more than justifies the cost expediting production so we can get a return on that investment sooner. Frankly, the adage "time is money" is almost backwards. Time is king.

Robot labor does not scale like human labor. Coordinating an increasing number of robots, hypothetically, is not as complicated as coordinating increasing numbers of people. When you aren't using them, you don't need to spend money to keep the waiting. Anyone who has worked in a production environment can tell you that time management of people is a key cost control. If production is halted, you still have to pay the human laborers to sit on their hands while blockers are removed. That is not so with robots. The operational expenditure is the electricity to run them. When they aren't working, they cost nothing.

This tips the scales even further towards mass robot employment. In our hypothetical example, why employ only 30 robots? Put 60, 90, maybe 100s in your force. The limit is how many you can reasonably expect to utilize in order to pay them off. Whatever that number is, it is most definitely in excess of the number of humans currently doing that job.

Following this line of reasoning to its conclusion, the 42 trillion USD that is produced by human labor today is going to be dwarfed by the productive capacity of robots. What that world looks like, I am not sure, but that's the direction we are currently going. 

## Well... Where Are They?

If you're like me, you've probably noticed that there isn't a robot at your local coffee shop. Its fair to say, the average person does not see a robot in their daily life, and for that matter, never has. If the robots are here, well... where are they?

The reason I think this issue has suddenly become prescient is that companies have recently solved (though not perfected) what I considered the major roadblocks for development and adoption. This is through advances in AI. Not simply the scale of models, but also in the development of novel methods.

### The Training Problem

Returning to our opening example, Spot cannot understand what you "want" if you talk to it. It has no concept of tasks or task completion. In order to get a robot like Spot or Atlas to do a human like task, you have to train it. Historically, this has been the task of engineering teams. The average person, or even the average engineer, could not do this. It is a field unto itself. This training process involves giving a model many examples of a task done correctly. This is time consuming and is applicable to a narrow scope. So while Atlas can perform backflips and jump between platforms, it does not know that you need a particular box, or how to carry it until you train it to do so.

This problem is not unique to Boston Dynamics. Every AI company needs training data for their models. Figure AI recently announced project [Go-Big](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/figure-ai_unlike-llms-we-cant-scrape-the-internet-activity-7374468701590511616-aBLM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB3tBEcB2yjex9y0J0poeWS1_daGkgFj4cU) where they are collecting video data of humans performing household chores. The idea is to train models on humans so that it can perform those tasks like they do. Like 1X, Figure wants to put robots in homes to enable people to live fulfilling lives. 

That said, general purpose robotics will not come from a limited dataset like that. This is where NVIDIA has been at the forefront of innovation. You've probably seen amazing AI generated videos. Google's Veo3 can produce strikingly realistic videos from text prompts. NVIDIA is using AI generated video in a unique way. [GROOT Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mwrfvq-GeY) produces AI generated video of a robot executing a task from text prompts. The 3D movements to match the generated video are calculated, and used to train the robot. 

This is, in my opinion, genius. Text based commands like "Grab the apple" become a training dataset that the AI can use to learn and execute the task. This brings the process of training a robot closer to the same level of difficulty as training a human. This is a major advancement that has gone largely unnoticed by the general public because of both its recency and the fact that you'd only care if you build robots. GROOT Dreams is part of NVIDIA Isaac, which a set of models which assist in the development and training of all types of robots.

This advancement is both a technical achievement and an accessibility achievement. In a world where controlling a robot is as simple as speaking to it, or giving it a written set of objectives, businesses of all types can adopt and implement robots into their workforce. What once required a team of specialized engineers, can now be done by any manager.

### Breaking Up the Problem

Training is not the only obstacle to progress. Robots, especially humanoid robots, are a multi-disciplinary field. The challenge of designing and training the "brain" of the robot is very different than designing the electric motor that powers its joints. Further yet, engineering is more than finding solutions to these problems, it is also their refinement into something scalable and cost effective.

Historically, robotics has been fairly vertically integrated. The company building the hardware also builds the software. Because the hardware and software are so tightly coupled, it is difficult to separate them. NVIDIA's development of Isaac is a catalyst for breaking this problem up. Now that training is more accessible than ever, research groups and startups can focus on building the novel approaches to intelligence.  

The most impressive example of this is Skild AI. In their [recent blogpost](https://www.skild.ai/blogs/omni-bodied) they discuss their philosophy to robot control, what they call the "omni-brain". This omni-brain model is trained on a dataset of many simulated robots, and is then given a new, real robot to control. Impressively, the same AI model can control the humanoid robot and the quadruped. Furthermore, it demonstrates the ability to adapt in real time to extreme morphological changes. Their demonstration video shows engineers cutting whole limbs off while the robot dog, and showing it adapt over the course of a few seconds to its handicapped state.

You'll notice though that Skild AI does not produce their own robots. The robots in most of their demonstrations are from a company called Unitree. Based in China, the company's catalogue includes several tiers of robotic arms, quadrupeds, and humanoids. What makes Unitree stand out is their remarkably low price tag compared to their predecessors. In fact, most robotics companies do not advertise prices up front for their humanoid and quadraped robots. Unitree will sell you their base model robot dog for [1600 USD](https://www.unitree.com/go2). Their entry humanoid is only [5900 USD](https://www.unitree.com/R1). 

This is a dramatic reduction from the 75K USD of Spot. It means that firms and research organizations don't need to focus on challenges of articulation, and instead can focus on the algorithms. Getting these machines in as many hands as possible will drive innovation on the software side. This works to the benefit of Unitree too. They can deliver robots with only "moderate" intelligence and focus their effort on affordability and scale.

There is no single approach to the intelligence architecture that is generally agreed upon. The quest for general purpose robotics is experiencing a similar process to that of agentic software. While LLM's themselves are capable of solving reasonably complex tasks with no structure or guidance, it is very clear that building some structure around them improves their task solving capabilities. Coding agents like Claude Code or Codex are examples of this. Their ability to develop working software is improved when you provide them tools and structure for using those tools. The same goes for robotics, and there are multiple approaches that companies are taking. 

Until very recently, task oriented AI models for robots where combining perception, reasoning and control all within a single neural network. These are "Vision Language Action" models, which attempt to map commands like "pick up the apple" to robot actions. While these can be trained to work, they are often fragile.

## The State of The Art

Google and [others](https://www.menteebot.com/blog/#menteebot-ai-approach) have recognized that traditional VLA models can work in tandem with modern reasoning models. They released Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, an "embodied reasoning" model which acts as an additional layer above a VLA model. This model commands the VLA and acts as a higher level thought process about the situation.

The [demonstration](https://youtu.be/AMRxbIO04kQ?si=gqjflbXUu7wXcmaH) of this is awe inspiring. Robots of various forms are shown to respond to novel commands, and successfully execute them using reasoning. Apptronik's humanoid robot is shown to pack a duffel bag upon command. Robotic arms reason about trash, and sort them into bins based on local guidance. This demonstration alone should convey that the robot future is here.

Cheap, accessible AI models from companies like Google, and the plummeting cost of hardware from companies like Unitree will drive further research and adoption. A positive feedback loop is formed, where adoption generates data for training, which increases model performance, and in turn promotes further adoption. So while robotics has been improving steadily over the past 10 years, we have hit an inflection point. The technical progress, societal pressure, and economic pressure are all primed for a revolution.

## What To Do?

For one, start paying attention. Its better to start following the news from robotics and AI companies now and not be so surprised when you start seeing them. Its hard to be sure how fast things will go, but there is a real possibility that they change very fast. Additionally, I think we should talk to each other about what we expect and want from a future where robots are alongside us. With that in mind, here are a few questions that you can share with others to start the conversation:

- Beyond oversight, what skills will be valuable in a world augmented by robotic labor?
- What laws and policies do we want in that future to ensure a prosperous and peaceful society? How would we enforce those laws?
- What are the biggest risks associated with a fast transition?
- How could your local community use robots to improve public services?
- What institutions (like healthcare or education) do you think stand the most to gain from robotics?
- What is the best possible outcome of a robot population explosion?
- What is the worst?
