# The Art of Noticing

Last Tuesday, I watched a stranger in a coffee shop receive news that made them cry with joy. They were sitting alone, earbuds in, when suddenly their face transformed. First disbelief, then a smile that seemed to crack their face in half, and finally, tears.

I never found out what the news was. A job offer? A medical test result? A message from someone long lost? It didn't matter. What mattered was witnessing that moment of pure, unfiltered human emotion.

## When Life Became a Blur

For years, I lived life at double speed. Wake up, check phone, shower while planning the day, coffee on the go, work, lunch at desk, more work, commute home while answering emails, dinner while watching TV, sleep, repeat.

I was efficient. Productive. And completely disconnected from my own life.

The wake-up call came during a conversation with my grandmother. She asked me about my favorite moment from the past month, and I couldn't answer. Not because nothing good had happened, but because I hadn't been present enough to notice.

## Learning to Slow Down

The change didn't happen overnight. It started small—a decision to drink my morning coffee without looking at my phone. Those ten minutes felt like an eternity at first. My fingers twitched toward the screen. My mind raced through my to-do list.

But slowly, I began to notice things:
- The way steam rose from my mug in delicate spirals
- The sound of birds outside my window (had they always been there?)
- The warmth of ceramic against my palms
- The gradual lightening of the sky as dawn broke

## Collecting Moments

I started keeping a "moment journal"—not a diary of events, but a collection of small observations:

**March 1st**: *An elderly couple at the park, holding hands while feeding ducks. They threw bread with the enthusiasm of children.*

**March 3rd**: *My neighbor's toddler discovered their shadow today. Spent ten minutes trying to step on it, giggling uncontrollably.*

**March 5th**: *Rain on the skylight sounded like gentle applause.*

**March 7th**: *Watched a businessman in a perfectly pressed suit stop to help a teenager whose skateboard had rolled into traffic. They high-fived after.*

## The Compound Effect of Attention

What surprised me most was how paying attention to small moments changed my experience of larger ones. When you practice noticing the everyday, you become more present for the big stuff too.

My sister's wedding wasn't just a blur of activities and obligations. I remember:
- The way her voice cracked slightly during the vows
- My father pretending not to cry while giving his speech
- The flower girl's look of intense concentration as she scattered petals
- The sunset that painted everyone golden during the reception

## Finding Magic in the Mundane

There's magic in ordinary moments, but it requires us to be present to see it. A commute becomes a study in human stories. Cooking dinner transforms into a sensory meditation. Even waiting in line becomes an opportunity to observe the beautiful chaos of human interaction.

## The Practice Continues

I'm not perfect at this. There are still days when I realize I've autopiloted through hours of my life. Days when stress or busyness pulls me back into that unconscious rushing.

But now I know how to return. I pause. I breathe. I look around and ask myself: *What's happening right now that I might want to remember?*

Because life isn't just the milestones—the graduations, promotions, weddings, and vacations. Life is also Tuesday morning coffee, unexpected rain showers, the way light falls across your desk at 3 PM, and strangers crying with joy in coffee shops.

The small moments, I've learned, aren't small at all. They're the threads that weave together to create the fabric of our lives. And when we pay attention, when we truly notice, we discover that ordinary life is anything but ordinary.

Joy doesn't always announce itself with fireworks. Sometimes it whispers in the steam rising from your morning coffee, waiting patiently for you to notice.
