This was his reward to himself. He had earned it. An electric white glow shone on the glossy yellow block; "PREMIUM IMITATION CHEESE" was written across the front. He stood there for a minute, immersed in the hum of the tube lighting which underscored the clicking and clacking of plastic carts shuffling around; carts with colorful products such as "nutritionally enriched meat substitute" with slogans that boasted "now 20% lighter plastic!"

This is where successful people buy their food. He was one of them now. The grit packed lines on his hands contrasted with the sterile object in it. Gritty he would be no longer. 12 years finally culminated in his promotion to "general overseer" of floor 1 of the "PENTAX Food Manufacturing Corporation." He no longer had to watch that single line of robots and machinery stamp, press, and inject plastic mesh until it resulted in those enticing imitations of "Pre-optimization" food. He could buy them for himself. His head swirled with excitement and prospection, "How much better would the flavor be?" He squeezed the light spongey rectangle and marveled at how "firm" it felt. Would it crumble like he had heard? Could it melt?

Deliberately, he set his reward in his basket and hastily shuffled through the crowd to toward the exit. His nerves heightened briefly as he stood in the payment kiosk. The steel gate, holding him in remained closed for longer than he could bare, though it were only a few seconds. A pure green "OK" appeared on the screen and he sighed with relief. His walk home was brisk, as a childish joy filled him. He was lost in his own mind, grateful that he could improve his life so materially.

He unloaded his various treasures, which included delicacies such as a neon red tube reading "IMITATION JELLY" and "STEAK FLAVORED STYRO-DISK". They stood in bright contrast to what had remained his cupboard prior. Solid white sponges with delicate plastic wraps reading "High Nutrition Polyethylene" and "Petro-meal." He quietly reflected on how his luck had now changed for the better. Holding the last item, his yellow glossy block, he decided to indulge himself.

With great tact, he tore a corner. An overwhelming musk filled his nose. Carefully placing it in his mouth, he bit down. "Oh my" He exclaimed in a hushed tone to himself. He chewed it deliberately, to savor the moment. The texture was smooth and the yellow mass broke easily. Each bite squelched against his teeth like rubber. The flavor was intense and tangy. Still chewing, he said "*Wow*, so this is the real thing?
