## Markdown Blog System

Your blog now supports markdown posts! Here's how to use it:

### Adding New Blog Posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in `/content/blog/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top with metadata:

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2024-03-20
excerpt: A brief description of your post
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
slug: custom-url-slug  # Optional: defaults to filename
---

# Your Markdown Content Here

Write your post using standard markdown...
```

That's it! Your new post will be automatically loaded and displayed on the blog. 

**URL Routing:**
- By default, the filename (without `.md`) becomes the post's URL: `/blog/your-filename`
- You can override this by adding `slug: custom-slug` in the frontmatter
- Each post gets its own unique URL that can be bookmarked and shared

## Stories System

Your site also supports personal stories with the same automatic loading system!

### Adding New Stories

1. Create a new `.md` file in `/content/stories/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top with metadata:

```markdown
---
title: Your Story Title
date: 2024-03-20
excerpt: A brief description of your story
category: Travel, Life, Growth, People, etc.
readTime: 5 min read
slug: custom-url-slug  # Optional: defaults to filename
---

# Your Story Content Here

Write your story using standard markdown...
```

That's it! Your new story will be automatically loaded and displayed in the stories section.

**URL Routing:**
- By default, the filename (without `.md`) becomes the story's URL: `/stories/your-filename`
- You can override this by adding `slug: custom-slug` in the frontmatter
- Each story gets its own unique URL that can be bookmarked and shared
